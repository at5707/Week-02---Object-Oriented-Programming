Overview 
The second week was dedicated to understanding the object-oriented programming concepts of the Java programming language. We covered the difference between procedural and object-oriented Java programs, class and object in Java, constructors, instance variables and access modifiers, various operators including this, static and instanceof, object modelling and various OOPs concepts like inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism, along with explaining interface and abstract classes. Along with that, we also learn about the use of Eclipse IDE.
